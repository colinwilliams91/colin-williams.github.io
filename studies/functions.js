 * FUNCTIONS
 * 
 * 0: A Function is a reusable piece of code. It can be defined after the keyword "function".
 * 
 * 1: A Function will sometimes expect parameters (function(para1, para2)).
 * these can be any data-type including other functions.
 * 
 * 2: What we pass into these parameters at the time of invocation (or the "call")
 * are called arguments, and will be used inside the function to determine the return.
 * 
 * 3: After these (parameters) we will {write a code block inside curly braces}
 * which will be executed whenever we call the function.
 * 
 * 4:

// FUNCTION DEFINITION / DECLARATION





// FUNCTION CALL / INVOCATION





// FUNCTION ARGUMENTS

/**
 * arguments passed to a function are actually an object that can be iterated through or accessed. ex: arguments[i], arguments.length
 */



// SCOPE

/**
 * Function Scope: When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that function and cannot be used outside that function.
 * 
 * Block Scope: variables declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop.
 * Variables declared within curly braces are refernced as within block scope.
